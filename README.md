### What I learned

This challenge was very straight forward, so I did not need to use stuff out of my repertoire to complete it. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="qr-container">
      <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code" class="qr-img" />
      <h1 class="qr-title">
        Improve your front-end skills by building projects
      </h1>
      <p class="qr-text">
        Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to
        the next level
      </p>
    </div>
```
```css
.qr-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin: 5rem auto;
  width: 20%;
  min-width: 300px;
  background-color: var(--light-color-1);
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 15px;
}

```


### Continued development

Getting better at determining sizes and colors by simple inspection, but still need to work on this.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - i used W3Schools to get how to apply border radius to independent corners of an element.
